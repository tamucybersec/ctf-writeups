# **Substitute - 40 pts**

You are given a text file which is encoded... but how do you decode it?

Files:
cipher.txt


## *Solution*

Looking at the first samples of the text itself, it seems like they used a cipher for encryption:
```
MIT YSAU OL OYGFSBDGRTKFEKBHMGCALSOQTMIOL.
```

Luckily, we *don't* have to analyze this cipher by hand, there are plenty of online resources which can do this for us. I utilized https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver, but before, I tried a Caesar cipher which did not work. You may not always diagnose what, exactly, the methods being used are, but you must ensure you are methodical in your treatment of each scenario that is presented to you. Be a creative problem solver, be thorough and motivated, and above all else, if you don't know something or are unsure, *google it.*
