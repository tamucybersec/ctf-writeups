# **computeRSA - 50 pts**

```
RSA encryption/decryption is based on a formula that anyone can find and use,
as long as they know the values to plug in. Given the encrypted number 150815, 
d = 1941, and N = 435979, what is the decrypted number?```

We are given the inputs and now must put them together in the formula. If you would care to know more about RSA's algorithm in detail, [check out the wiki](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm)

### Step 1: lug in numbers to algorithm
I used [this site](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~introcs/Fa11/notes/10.1_Cryptography/RSA_Express_EncryptDecrypt.html) to find out the decrypted number.
